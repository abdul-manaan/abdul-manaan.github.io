Iâ€™m currently a graduate student at Brown University studying Computer Science. I am also part of Brown University Systems Research Group, with a focus on developing tools and systems to understand and improve the performance of the existing systems (like webpages or QUIC protocol). My interests revolve around computer networks, distributed systems and software development.


## Current Interests and Projects:

- Filtering SysCalls from Dynamic Programming Languages
- Designed a distributed fuzz-testing framework to automate the analysis and debugging of QUIC
- Analysing Google's AMP Pages
